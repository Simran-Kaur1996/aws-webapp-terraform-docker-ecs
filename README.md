![Alt text describing the image](1.Terraform-Ecommerce (2).jpg)

## Project Overview

In this repository, I use **Terraform** to automate the provisioning of AWS resources for hosting a dynamic website. Key components include:

- **Amazon S3**: For static content storage and hosting.
- **Amazon CloudFront**: To deliver content globally with low latency.
- **AWS EC2**: For hosting dynamic back-end content (if applicable).
- **Amazon Route 53**: Optional DNS management for custom domain setup.
- **Docker**: Containerizing the web app for consistency and portability.
- **Terraform**: For fully automating infrastructure deployment.

## Key Skills Demonstrated

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** with **Terraform** for cloud resource provisioning.
- Proficiency in **AWS** services: **S3**, **CloudFront**, **EC2**, **Route 53**, and **IAM**.
- **Docker** containerization for modern application deployment.
- Solid understanding of **cloud security**, **scalability**, and **performance optimization**.
- **Version control** with **Git** for collaboration and tracking changes.

## Features

- **Automated Deployment**: Fully automated infrastructure setup with **Terraform**, ensuring consistency and repeatability.
- **Scalable Hosting**: Uses **S3** and **CloudFront** to ensure the website scales automatically and performs reliably.
- **Dockerized App**: Simplifies the development and deployment process, ensuring compatibility across environments.
- **Custom Domain Integration**: Easily configure a custom domain using **Route 53** (optional).

## Why This Project?

- **Cloud Automation**: This project highlights my ability to automate and manage cloud infrastructure, a critical skill for modern cloud-native applications.
- **AWS Expertise**: Hands-on experience with AWS services such as **S3**, **EC2**, **CloudFront**, and **Route 53**, demonstrating real-world cloud architecture knowledge.
- **Scalability & Performance**: The architecture is designed for high performance, low latency, and seamless scaling, utilizing AWS best practices.
- **Containerization**: Docker ensures consistency across environments, streamlining development and production deployments.
